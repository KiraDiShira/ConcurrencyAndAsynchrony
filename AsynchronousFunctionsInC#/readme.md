# Asynchronous Functions in C#

- [Awaiting](#awaiting)

## Awaiting

The await keyword simplifies the attaching of continuations. The compiler expands:

```c#

var result = await expression;
statement(s);

```

into something functionally similar to:

```c#

var awaiter = expression.GetAwaiter();
awaiter.OnCompleted(() =>
{
    var result = awaiter.GetResult();
    statement(s);
});

```

Example:

```c#

async void DisplayPrimesCount()
{
    int result = await GetPrimesCountAsync(2, 1000000);
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}

Task<int> GetPrimesCountAsync(int start, int count)
{
    return Task.Run(() =>
        ParallelEnumerable.Range(start, count).Count(n =>
            Enumerable.Range(2, (int)Math.Sqrt(n) - 1).All(i => n % i > 0)));
}

```

The async modifier tells the compiler to treat await as a keyword rather than an identifier should an ambiguity arise within that method (this ensures that code written prior to C# 5 that might use await as an identifier will still compile without error). The async modifier can be applied only to methods (and lambda expressions) that return void or (as weâ€™ll see later) a Task or Task<TResult>.

The expression upon which you await is typically a task; however, any object with a GetAwaiter method that returns an awaitable object (implementing INotifyComple tion.OnCompleted and with an appropriately typed GetResult method and a bool IsCompleted property) will satisfy the compiler.
